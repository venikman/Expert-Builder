# F# idioms and functional patterns (F# for Fun and Profit inspired)

This repo is a small, runnable set of F# script examples (`.fsx`), one file per idiom/pattern.

## How to run
Use F# Interactive:
- `dotnet fsi src/01_BindingNotAssignment.fsx`

Each script includes a tiny "test" via `assert` or a printed example.

## Scope
These are idioms/patterns commonly emphasized on fsharpforfunandprofit.com (Scott Wlaschin).
They are examples, not a full copy of the site.

## Files
See `src/00_Index.fsx` for a short index.
